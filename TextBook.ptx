	<title>Discrete Mathematics for Computing</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>A reader-friendly text for a first-year course in Discrete Mathematics,
			focused on students pursuing majors involving computing.</p>

			<title>About This Text</title>
			
			<p>This interactive, IBL, text was designed for use in a first-year
			 course in Discrete Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University. 
			 The course is designed for students taking a first semester of discrete 
			 mathematics in conjunction with an introductory programming course. 
			 Discrete mathematics content is introduced in time for it to be utilized 
			 in the corrsponding programming class.</p>
			
			<p>At Southern New Hampshire University, first-semester Computer Science 
			students take CS113 (an introductory course in C++) and also traditionally 
			took a course in Discrete Mathematics designed for general education 
			purposes. In 2020, this Discrete Mathematics course was phased out and was 
			replaced by a Discrete Mathematics for Computing course. Topics from the 
			original Discrete Mathematics course were rearranged such that they are 
			covered in time to be used in the CS113 class. Because the course is 
			advertised as a mathematics <i>for computing</i> course, connections are 
			explicitly made between mathematics and programming concepts.</p>
			
			<p>Since the course has been developed, students majoring in Information 
			Technology and students majoring in Game Programming have been encouraged 
			by their major faculty to enroll as well. Those programs utilize Python and 
			C#, respectively, in their first-semester coursework. For these reasons, 
			we've attempted to build the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course (and 
			this accompanying text) as "language agnostic" experiences. A table of 
			aligned coverage for the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course and the 
			corresponding first-semester programming coursework in the partner programs 
			appears below.</p>

			<section xml:id = "Base-Reps-Intro">
				<title>Introduction</title>
				
				<p>A short introductory section designed to be read before students 
				attend class. This section addresses why humans developed a base-10 
				number system as well as where other systems find natural applications.</p>

				<p>Humans devised a base-10 number system simply because the species
				evolved with 10 fingers. We could have used any other base system -- in
				fact, some ancient civilizations did. The ancient Sumerians and 
				Babylonians (3000BCE and 2000BCE, respectively) used base-60, while the 
				Mayans and Aztecs adopted base-20 (circa 1400CE and 1500CE, respectively). 
				The Alaskan IÃ±upak as well as the Eskimo-Aleut languages all include a 
				base-20 numeral system in their current forms.</p>

				<p>What's so special about base-10, base-20, or base-60? The Babylonians 
				are credited with developing the concept of a 24-hour day, with each hour 
				broken into 60-minutes and each minute broken into 60-seconds. The number 
				60 was attractive because it had many <i>factors</i>. The numbers 2, 3, 4, 
				5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 all divide evenly into 60. This meant that
				working in base-60 often made fractions easy to work with. One conjectured
				reason that the Mayans utilized a Base-20 system is that they lived in a
				warm climate, where they simply didn't wear shoes. Having their toes 
				exposed meant an additional set of 10 digits readily available for 
				counting.</p>

				<p>Perhaps not [currently] qualifying as a civilization, but an important
				component of our lives nonetheless are machines -- more specifically,
				computers. Computers don't have the advantage, nor the awareness, of 
				fingers or toes. They're simply aware of the presence or absence of 
				electrical pulses. Because of this, it is natural for them to process and
				store information in a base-2 system -- a system more commonly known as
				<i>binary</i>.</p>

				<title>Converting from Non-Standard Bases into Base 10</title>

				<p>Before discussing a strategy for converting from non-standard bases 
				back to the base-10 (decimal) system, it is worth considering how 
				counting in the decimal system works. Have you ever considered what the
				number 927 really means? Below is an insightful expansion.</p>

				<example xml:id = "int-expansion-ex"> <title> The real meaning of 927</title>
					
					<md>
					<mrow>927 = 9*(10^2) + 2*(10^1) + 7*(10^0)</mrow> 
					</md>			
				</example>

				<p>The example above highlights the role of <i>place-value</i> in any
				number system, not just our own decimal system. The place of the digit
				determines the power of the base which it is attached to. The rightmost
				digit, perhaps you've referred to it as the singles digit, is attached
				to the <m>0^{th}</m> power of the base. The second digit from the right 
				is attached to the <m>1^{st}</m> power of the base. With each successive 
				position (towards the left) the digit is attached to an increasing power
				of the relevant base.</p> 

				<example xml:id = "identify-place-value-1">
					<title>Check Your Understanding!</title>
					What power of 10 is the digit 8 attached to in the expansion of the
					number 586325?
					<solution>
					<md>
						<m>586325 = 5*(10^5) + 8*(10^4) + 6*(10^3) + 3*(10^2) + 2*(10^1) + 
						5*(10^0)</m>
					</md>
					<p>So the digit <m>8</m> is attached to <m>10^4</m>.</p>
					</solution>
				</example>
