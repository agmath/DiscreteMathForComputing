<p>You have all the tools you need to analyze compound logical statements with the help of truth tables. As such, this subsection mainly consists of embedded example problems for you to solve. As usual, these embedded examples are interactive and will help you check your understanding. The earliest examples involve truth tables that are mostly set up for you. The final examples ask you to construct nearly all aspects of the truth tables while you build your solutions. The examples slowly build you up to being able to approach these problems independently.</p>
