<p>In this chapter, we encourage the reader to try one or more projects which tie together some of the material we've encountered over the previous three chapters. You'll also need to remember content from those earlier chapters as well. The majority of the projects proposed in this chapter can be done with or without writing code. That being said, some projects are made easier (or perhaps more interesting) with the use of code. In particular, readers who would like to solve general versions of the project scenarios proposed will find that writing simulations can give great insights when the mathematics becomes difficult or unwieldy.</p>
