<p>Up to this point, we've discussed converting from base-<span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to base-<span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> and also from base-<span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> to base-<span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> We also discussed conversions between binary and either the octal or hexadecimal systems. We saw that this was made convenient because each group of three bits could be encoded as a single octal digit, and similarly each group of four bits could be encoded as a single hexadecimal digit. The relationship between the bases (<span class="process-math">\(8 = 2^3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(16 = 2^4\)</span>) is what made this possible. Such a quick conversion is not even possible between octal and hexadecimal because <span class="process-math">\(16\)</span> is not a positive integer power of <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span></p>
