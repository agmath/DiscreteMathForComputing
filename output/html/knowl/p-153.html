<p>In this Squid Game-inspired project, you'll analyse a bridge- crossing game. Various scenarios will be considered. In each scenario, the game is as follows. All players begin at one end of the bridge, with the goal of getting all the way to the other side. The bridge consists of glass panes, each of which will turn red or green when stepped on. If a player stops on a pane and it turns red, that player is out. All lit panes remain lit for the entirety of the game (so later players have an advantage). Players will cross the bridge one at a time, in a predetermined order. You may also assume that the glass panes are large enough that players may not jump over segments of the bridge. That is, in the picture below, the players begin from the left side of the bridge and each player must step on one of the two panes in each column in an attempt to reach the right hand side of the bridge.</p>
