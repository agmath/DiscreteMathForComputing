<p>At Southern New Hampshire University, first-semester Computer Science students take CS113 (an introductory course in C++) and also traditionally took a course in Discrete Mathematics designed for general education purposes. In 2020, this Discrete Mathematics course was phased out and was replaced by a Discrete Mathematics for Computing course. Topics from the original Discrete Mathematics course were rearranged such that they are covered in time to be used in the CS113 class. Because the course is advertised as a mathematics for computing course, connections are explicitly made between mathematics and programming concepts.</p>
