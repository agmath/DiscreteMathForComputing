<p>Before we exit this chapter, its worth mentioning that multidimensional arrays (arrays with more than just rows and columns) exist and find lots of uses in the real world. For example, a three-dimensional array is requird to define the colors of the pixels on your computer monitor right now. You can think of such an array as containing a matrix for the <em class="emphasis">red</em> channel, another matrix for the <em class="emphasis">green</em> channel, and a third matrix for the <em class="emphasis">blue</em> channel. Perhaps there is a fourth matrix governing the opacity (equivalently, the level of transparency) of the pixel. This is often referred to as an <em class="emphasis">alpha</em> channel.</p>
