<p>Up to this point, we've discussed converting from base-\(b\) to base-\(10\) and also from base-\(10\) to base-\(b\text{.}\) We also discussed conversions between binary and either the octal or hexadecimal systems. We saw that this was made convenient because each group of three bits could be encoded as a single octal digit, and similarly each group of four bits could be encoded as a single hexadecimal digit. The relationship between the bases, \(8 = 2^3\) and \(16 = 2^4\) is what made this possible. Such a quick conversion is not even possible between octal and hexadecimal because \(16\) is not a positive integer power of \(8\text{.}\)</p>
