<p>In the first two sections of this chapter on arrays, we've encountered one-dimensional arrays (sometimes referred to as vectors), and two-dimensional arrays (often referred to as matrices). Arrays are important structures in mathematics and also in computing. We've spent our time focused on operations which can be done with arrays and some example implementations of algorithms that compute those operations. We've ignored the technical aspects of arrays from a computer science perspective since you'll get that exposure in computer science coursework.</p>
