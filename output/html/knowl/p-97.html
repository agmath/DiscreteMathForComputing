<p>We'll refer to an <em class="emphasis">atomic statement</em> as a statement which cannot be decomposed into smaller substatements. For example, the statement "it is raining" is an atomic statement, while the statement "it is raining and I have an umbrella" is not an atomic statement. The latter can be decomposed into the atomic statements "it is raining" and "I have an umbrella". In symbolic logic we'll use letters like <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> etc. to represent atomic statements. For example,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{gather*}
p:~ \text{I am writing in Python}\\
q:~ \text{I am using correct indentation}\\
r:~ \text{my code will run}
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Each of those statements listed above is an atomic statement which cannot be decomposed into smaller sub-statements. Using <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to represent their corresponding statements is convenient and efficient.</p>
