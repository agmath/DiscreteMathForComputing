<p>What's so special about base-10, base-20, or base-60? The Babylonians are credited with developing the concept of a 24-hour day, with each hour broken into 60-minutes and each minute broken into 60-seconds. The number 60 was attractive because it had many <em class="emphasis">factors</em>. The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 all divide evenly into 60. This meant that working in base-60 often made fractions easy to work with. One conjectured reason that the Mayans utilized a Base-20 system is that they lived in a warm climate, where they simply didn't wear shoes. Having their toes exposed meant an additional set of 10 digits readily available for counting.</p>
