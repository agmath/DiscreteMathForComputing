<p>Now that we've seen conditionals as well as our logical connectors in action, let's see a slightly more advanced feature of code. We'll explore loops, which can help us re-run the same set of instructions many times. We'll make use of two types of loop here because they'll be helpful to us when we return to develop a base-conversion function which will convert between two arbitraty bases (although we'll build a function that only works as long as those bases are both at most 10).</p>
