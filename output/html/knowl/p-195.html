<p>In this and the previous section you were exposed two one- and two-dimensional arrays. You've seen how simple mathematical operations, including scalar multiplication, addition/subtraction, and products. We saw that there are at least two ways to define vector products, including the inner- and outer-products. Spoiler alert, there are more, and you'll encounter them elsewhere. We saw that multiplication is not a commutative operation with arrays. That is, <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is not generally the same as <span class="process-math">\(BA\)</span> -- in fact, knowing that the product <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is defined doesn't even guarantee that the product <span class="process-math">\(BA\)</span> is defined.</p>
