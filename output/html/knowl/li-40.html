</h6>Consider a competitive coloring game, called Achievement, in which two players alternate turns coloring a path on n vertices with a single color. Players must color according to proper coloring rules. The goal of the game is to be the last player to properly color a vertex along the path. Explore the Achievement game on paths of varying lengths. Can you identify whether it is better to be the first or second player to color a vertex in this game? What strategies can you identify to guarantee that your choice (of going first or second) will end in you winning? On which types of paths does your winning strategy work?</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_p3-coloring.html#li-40">in-context</a></span>
