<p><em class="emphasis">Topic Expectations.</em> A complete submission for this topic will include solutions to all three of the problems mentioned in the topic description above. Solutions alone, however, are not enough to earn full credit for the assignment. The quality of your synopses of the required readings as well as your discussions around the solutions to the problems is of primary importance. In particular, you should write your paper so that someone in our class could read and understand how to use these new counting techniques, and understand how you approached the problems.</p>
