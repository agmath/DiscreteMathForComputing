<p>At the end of the previous section, you were promised learning how to compute the outer-product between two one-dimensional arrays. We've blown by that, but will return to it now. With the addition of a simple initial step, computing the outer-product becomes a special case of the matrix multiplication you've just learned. Given two one-dimensional arrays, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> we'll tip <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> on its side so that it becomes a <em class="emphasis">row vector</em> rather than a <em class="emphasis">column vector</em>. We'll call this taking the <em class="emphasis">transpose</em> of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and denote it by <span class="process-math">\(B^T\text{.}\)</span> The new array <span class="process-math">\(B^T\)</span> then has a single row. Since the array <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has a single column, then matrix multiplication is defined between these two objects. If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an array of length <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is an array of length <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> then the outer product <span class="process-math">\(AB^T\)</span> is a two-dimensional array with <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> rows and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns. See the example below.</p>
