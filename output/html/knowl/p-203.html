<p><em class="emphasis">Graph Pebbling.</em> Consider a graph in which a non-negative integer number of currency (pebbles) are placed at each vertex. That is, some vertices may have no pebbles, while others have a positive whole number of pebbles. The goal of graph pebbling is to carry at least one pebble to a target vertex that begins with no pebbles. Each time a stack of pebbles is moved along an edge, a 50% "tax" must be paid. That is, if you move a stack of 6 pebbles from a vertex to one of its neighbors, only 3 pebbles arrive at the neighbor, and the other three are lost. Similarly, if a stack of 9 pebbles are moved, only 4 will remain (there is no way to make "change" in pebbling).</p>
