<p>Complete the examples below to verify your grasp of algorithmic complexity and big-O notation. Please note that the algorithms are written in pseudocode, and the algorithms don't necessarily claim to solve their corresponding challenge in the most efficient manner possible. Your answers should describe the algorithmic complexity of the routines as written in the sample problems. Interested readers may try writing working versions of these routines in a language of their choice, and are invited to think about optimizing the algorithms.</p>
