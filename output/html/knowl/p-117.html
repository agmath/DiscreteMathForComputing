<p>At the close of the previous section, you were introduced to the notion of <em class="emphasis">logical equivalence</em>. We saw there that two logical expressions are said to be logically equivalent if they have exactly the same truth values under exactly the same conditions for their atomic statements. This affords us an opportunity to discuss "simplification" of logical expressions. Indeed, it is preferrable to use fewer atomic statements and fewer operations whenever possible. This is especially true in the context of computing, which we'll discuss explicitly in the final two sections of this chapter.</p>
