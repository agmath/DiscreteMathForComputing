<p>Perhaps you are convinced that the binary system is important because machines lack fingers and toes to count on, but why are the octal and hexadecimal systems also used? Binary encodings can be quite lengthy. To represent the number <span class="process-math">\(\left(999\right)_{10}\text{,}\)</span> we need <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> bits. Its difficult to extract any meaning from such a number by looking at its binary representation. By grouping bits together, we can achieve more efficient encodings. Additionally, since we are simply grouping adjacent bits together with one another, we can quickly convert between binary and either octal, hexadecimal, or even whatever fancy name you want to give to a base-32 or base-64 numbering system. Let's take a look at an example below.</p>
