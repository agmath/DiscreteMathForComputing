<p><em class="emphasis">Eulerian Circuits and Hamiltonian Cycles.</em> In this project, students will explore Eulerian Circuits as well as Hamiltonian Cycles in graphs. As part of your project, you should be sure to define both Eulerian circuits and Hamiltonian cycles, construct examples of graphs for which these structures exist and other examples of graphs for which they do not exist. Your project should also discuss the conditions under which these structures can be found in graphs. You may even elect to discuss some interesting applications of these structures or some existing unsolved problems involving them.</p>
