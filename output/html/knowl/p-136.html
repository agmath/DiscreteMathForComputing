<p>In order to successfully navigate this section, you'll need to recall how base-conversion works (from Chapter 1). You'll also need to use what we learned about logic and how it can be used for programmatic flow control. That is, you'll need to recall what we learned about <em class="emphasis">If/Then</em> statements. You'll also need to make use of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">while</code> loops. This section is a great opportunity to connect our discrete math content to the topics you've been learning and implementing in your introductory coding course.</p>
