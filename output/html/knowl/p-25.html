<p>There are several non-standard bases which are commonly utilized in computing. In particular, it is not surprising to encounter the binary, octal, or hexadecimal systems. Binary is commonly encountered because computers <em class="emphasis">think</em> in terms of the presence or absence of an electrical signal. Recognizing that there are only two observable states shows why we are limited to two digits. Binary encodings can be quite long and cumbersome, grouping bits together can reduce the "length" of an encoding. For example, grouping every three consecutive bits together results in an octal encoding whole grouping every four consecutive bits together results in a hexadecimal encoding. It is very fast to switch between any of these three number systems because of this relationship.</p>
