<p>In order to start working with sets, we'll need to introduce some notation. As mentioned in the introduction to this champter, a <em class="emphasis">set</em> is a (possibly empty) collection of items, called <em class="emphasis">elements</em>. A useful mental paradigm for sets is to think of a set as a "bag of items". The elements of a set are the items which can be observed by reaching into the bag and taking something out. In general, sets will be denoted using capital letters such as <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> etc. Elements of those sets will be denoted using lowercase letters. We have the following additional notation for working with sets.</p>
