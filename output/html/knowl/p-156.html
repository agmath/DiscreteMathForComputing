<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The bridge contains 2 glass panes in each segment and there are 18 segments to cross the entire bridge. That is, the bridge is like the one in the image above, but it contains 18 columns rather than just four. Each segment contains one pane that will light green and one pane that will light red.</p></li>
