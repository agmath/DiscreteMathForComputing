<p>We've spent the last few chapters of this book discussing counting, functions, and probability. These are all very impotant ideas in computing. In the last section of the chapter on counting, we showed how you can apply counting techniques to better understand both the run-time and space complexity of any short programs you write. You can apply those techniques to analyze complexity for much larger, and comprehensive routines. In the chapter on functions, we explored the concepts of domain and codomain. We noted that functions can take zero or more parameters (inputs), and that functions can be chained together via an operation called <em class="emphasis">composition</em>. This allows for output values produced by one function to be used an an input value for another function. This is a commonly occurring phenomenon in computing. Finally, in the chapter on probability, we applied what we learned in the counting chapter to discrete probability. We also encountered discrete probability distributions like the Binomial and Poisson distributions which find lots of applications.</p>
