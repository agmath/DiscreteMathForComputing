<p>In the previous subsection, we identified how number systems in different bases work, and highlighted how it is just a generalization of representing numbers using our common decimal system. From that discussion, we see that the binary system utilizes only two digits, 0 and 1, and place-values are attached to increasing powers of 2 as we move towards the left. These <em class="emphasis">bi</em>nary dig<em class="emphasis">its</em> are often referred to as <em class="emphasis">bits</em>. Moving to the octal system, we can deduce that it utilizes eight digits, 0 through 7, and that place-values are determined by increasing powers of 8 as we move towards the left.</p>
