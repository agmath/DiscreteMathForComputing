<p>Complete the following checkpoint exercises to gain some familiarity with analyzing operations within a function. For reasons that will become clear later in the section, you'll be asked to ignore any "operations" required to initialize variables, initialize a loop, or return a result back to the computing environment. Additionally, you can consider lines combining arithmetic operations and updating a stored value to be a single operation. That is, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x = x + i</code> can be considered a single operation in the checkpoint items below. The reason we can do this will be addressed when <em class="emphasis">big-O</em> notation is introduced later in the section.</p>
