  <introduction>
    <p>Humans devised a base-10 number system simply because the species
	evolved with 10 fingers. We could have used any other base-system -- in
	fact, some ancient civilizations did. The ancient Sumerians and 
	Babylonians (3000BCE and 2000BCE, respectively) used base-60, while the 
	Mayans and Aztecs adopted base-20 (circa 1400CE and 1500CE, respectively). 
	The Alaskan IÃ±upak as well as the Eskimo-Aleut languages all include a 
	base-20 numeral system in their current forms.</p>

	<p>What's so special about base-10, base-20, or base-60? The Babylonians 
	are credited with developing the concept of a 24-hour day, with each hour 
	broken into 60-minutes and each minute broken into 60-seconds. The number 
	60 was attractive because it had many <em>factors</em>. The numbers 2, 3, 4, 
	5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 all divide evenly into 60. This meant that
	working in base-60 often made fractions easy to work with. One conjectured
	reason that the Mayans utilized a Base-20 system is that they lived in a
	warm climate, where they simply didn't wear shoes. Having their toes 
	exposed meant an additional set of 10 digits readily available for 
	counting.</p>

	<p>Perhaps not [currently] qualifying as a civilization, but an important
	component of our lives nonetheless are machines -- more specifically,
	computers. Computers don't have the advantage, nor the awareness, of 
	fingers or toes. They're simply aware of the presence or absence of 
	electrical pulses. Because of this, it is natural for them to process and
	store information in a base-2 system -- a system more commonly known as
	<em>binary</em>.</p>
