    <p> The goal for this project is to write a program (using either 
    a coding language of your choice, or pseudocode) to convert integer 
    values between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations. We 
    will use what we learned about number representations, 
    base-conversion, and logic (particularly if/then statements) here.
    </p>
    <p> Disclaimer: We may not be using the most efficient code or best 
    programming practices here. The goal is simply to connect our 
    coursework to computing.

  <!-- Sections can be written directly here, but it might help  -->
  <!-- with organization to include them as separate files.      -->
  <!-- That way it is easy to include the section in a different -->
  <!-- chapter later if you change your mind about the order.    -->
