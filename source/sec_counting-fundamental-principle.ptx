  <title>The Fundamental Principle of Counting</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this very short section we build on those very small-scale 
    examples in the Counting Basics section and develop the Fundamental 
    Principle of Counting. Like the previous section, we'll develop 
    mastery through a series of examples with increasing level of 
    difficulty.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection><title>Motivation</title>
    <p>In the previous section, we considered <em>atomic</em> processes, which 
      we described as processes which couldn't be broken down into smaller, 
      sub-processes. Examples of these atomic events were the roll of a single
      die or the flip of a coin, but not the rolling of a die and flipping of a 
      coin. Indeed, rolling a die and flipping a coin is not an atomic process 
      because it consists of two sub-processes (the rolling of the die and the 
      flipping of the coin). In this section, we consider how to count the 
      number of outcomes possible for this more complex process, and other 
      complex processes too.
    </p>

    <p>Let's start by considering the process of rolling a fair, six-sided die
      and then flipping a coin, as described above and in the previous section.
      There are six outcomes possible from the die roll. Those are depicted in
      the image on the left, below. For each of the six possible outcomes of 
      the die roll, there are two possible outcomes of the coin flip. A tree 
      depicting possible outcomes from the entire process (coin flip and then
      die roll) appears on the right, below.

  <p>Notice that for each of the six possible outcomes of the die roll, there are
  two possible coin flip outcomes. That is, the number of outcomes possible from 
  the die roll and coin flip process is <m>6\cdot \left(2\right) = 12</m>. 
  </p>

<subsection><title>The Fundamental Principle of Counting (and Examples)</title>
  
  <introduction>The multiplicative approach at the end of the previous subsection 
  works in general. The following fact, labeled the Fundamental Principal of 
  Counting, summarizes this idea.
  </introduction>

  <fact>
    <title>Fundamental Principle of Counting</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    If <m>P</m> is a process consisting of two sub-processes, <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m>,
    and the number of outcomes from <m>P_1</m> is <m>n_1</m> while the number of possible
    possible outcomes from <m>P_2</m> is <m>n_2</m>, then the total number of outcomes 
    possible for the process <m>P</m> is <m>n_1\cdot n_2</m>. Furthermore, if the process 
    <m>P</m> consists of <m>k</m> subprocesses, <m>P_1,~P_2,~\cdots,~P_k</m>, and the 
    number of possible outcomes for <m>P_i</m> is <m>n_i</m>, then the total number of 
    outcomes possible for the entire process <m>P</m> is <m>n_1\cdot n_2\cdot\cdots\cdot n_k</m>.
    </p>
    </statement>
  </fact>

  <p>Let's work through one example using the <em>Fundamental Principle of Counting</em> 
  and then you'll have an opportunity to test your understanding by completing several 
  embedded examples.
  </p>

  <example xml:id = "int-expansion-ex"> <title> Ordering From a Restaurant</title>
	<statement><p>You are out to eat with some friends at a restaurant. This particular restaurant has
  a relatively small menu, but every order comes with an entree, a drink, and a dessert. 
  The menue has seven different entrees, five different drinks, and four different dessert
  options. How many different orders are possible?
  </p>
  </statement>
  <answer><p>Notice that there are seven (7) options for an entree, five (5) options for a 
  drink, and four (4) options for dessert. For every choice of entree, there are five 
  options for a drink, and for every combination of entree and drink there are four optons 
  for dessert. Using the Fundamental Principle of Counting, the total number of orders is 
  the product of the number of entrees, number of drinks, and number of desserts. That is,
  the number of orders is <m>\boxed{\displaystyle{7\cdot\left(5\cdot 4\right) = 140}}</m>. 			
	</p>
  </answer>

  </subsection>

  <conclusion>In this section, you learned and applied the <em>Fundamental Principle of 
  Counting</em>. This principle allows us to count the number of outcomes (or ways to 
  complete) a process involving multiple sub-processes. Once we know the number of  
  outcomes possible for each sub-process, then we just multiply these values together 
  to obtain the total number of outcomes possible for the overall process. In the next 
  section, we'll be formally introduced to two new tools for computing the number of 
  ways to <em>arrange</em> a set of objects in a particular order, and also the number 
  of ways to <em>select</em> a subset of objects from a collection. We'll see you there!
