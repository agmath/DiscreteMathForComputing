  <title>The Fundamental Principle of Counting</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this section we build on those very small-scale examples in 
    the Counting Basics section and develop the Fundamental 
    Principle of Counting. Like the previous section, we'll develop 
    mastery through a series of examples with increasing level of 
    difficulty.</p>
