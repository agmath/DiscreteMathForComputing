  <title>Discrete Probability and Counting</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In our [insert cross-refernce here] chapter on counting, we encountered
    several tools for counting the number of ways to complete a potentially 
    complex process. If, instead of complex processes, we think about 
    potentially complex <em>events</em>, we can use those same counting 
    techniques to count the number of possible outcomes of an event (even the
    number of possible outcomes satisfying some restrictive requirements).
    We'll revisit those counting tools throughout this section (and the rest 
    of this chapter), as we develop an ability to discuss, describe, and 
    compute probabilities.
