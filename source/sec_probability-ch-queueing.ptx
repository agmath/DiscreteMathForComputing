  <title>Introduction to Queueing</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>A queueing system is any system which involves waiting in a line for 
    service. Queueing systems can be simple single-line, single-server systems 
    like the drive through at your favorite coffee shop. They can involve a 
    single line with multiple servers, like the tellers' desk at your local 
    Credit Union. A system may involve multiple queues and servers in parallel. 
    Perhaps you've been at a DMV location where you wait in a line to check in, 
    and then wait in a line again to be served at the appropriate window. There 
    are lots and lots of types of queueing systems. So much so that there are 
    courses on queuing and researchers who make their livelihoods better 
    understanding these systems and proposing methods for making them more 
    efficient. We'll just get some basic exposure here.

  <subsection><title>Queueing Basics</title>
    <p>This subsection introduces the terminology required to discuss queueing. 
    In particular, we introduce the notion of a queue, a server, interarrival 
    times, and service times.
    <ul>
        <li> Queue: The line portion of a queing system. New arrivals begin at 
        the rear of the queue and make their way to the head of the queue as 
        earlier arrivals are served and released from the queue. Queues are 
        assumed to follow FIFO (First in, First out -- or First come, first serve).</li>
        <li> Server: The point at which queue members are serviced and released from 
        the queue.</li>
        <li> Interarrival Times: The time between consecutive requests arriving to wait 
    in line.</li>
        <li>Service Times: The time it takes to serve and release the 
    head member from the queue.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection><title>Random Arrival Times</title>
    <p>Randomness is a key component of queuing systems. In particular, the 
    "interarrival times" and "service times" can both be assumed random.
