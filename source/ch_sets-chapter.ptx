  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter, we'll explore <em>sets</em>, which are a 
    fundamental object in mathematics. Simply put, a set is a collection
    of items. Those items are often called <em>elements</em> of the set. 
    It is often helpful to visualize a set as a (possibly empty) bag of 
    elements. We'll explore properties and manipulations of these "bags 
    of elements" for the duration of the chapter.

    <p>This chapter will eventually include the following sections.
    <ul>
      <li> Foundations for Working with Sets</li>
      <li> Set Operations</li>
      <li> Sets of Sets</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

  <!-- Sections can be written directly here, but it might help  -->
  <!-- with organization to include them as separate files.      -->
  <!-- That way it is easy to include the section in a different -->
  <!-- chapter later if you change your mind about the order.    -->
