  <title>Converting Between Arbitrary Bases</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Up to this point, we've discussed converting from base-<m>b</m> to 
    base-<m>10</m> and also from base-<m>10</m> to base-<m>b</m>. We also 
    discussed conversions between binary and either the octal or hexadecimal 
    systems. We saw that this was made convenient because each group of 
    three bits could be encoded as a single octal digit, and similarly 
    each group of four bits could be encoded as a single hexadecimal digit. 
    The relationship between the bases, <m>8 = 2^3</m> and <m>16 = 2^4</m> 
    is what made this possible. Such a quick conversion is not even possible 
    between octal and hexadecimal because <m>16</m> is not a positive integer 
    power of <m>8</m>.
    </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, in order to convert between two arbitrary bases, we 
    are stuck with converting to base-<m>10</m> and then from base-<m>10</m> 
    into the desired new base. We're already comfortable with each of these 
    individual tasks, so rather than waste time with arbitrary 
    base-conversions now, let's revisit this a bit later in our course.
