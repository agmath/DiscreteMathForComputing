  <title>Consecutive Events: Independence or Dependence</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        In the previous section, we were interested in a single outcome 
        associated with a single (atomic) process. We learned and practiced
        how to compute probabilities associated with outcomes/events that were
        determined by multiple restrictions (drawing a red card and a face card) 
        as well as outcomes that were described by "options" (drawing a red card 
        or a face card).
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section we'll be interested in outcomes associated with distinct 
        processes. For example, perhaps we roll a die and then draw a card from a 
        deck. Similarly, perhaps we deal two cards from a deck rather than a single 
        card. In this latter example, we can consider the drawing of each individual 
        card as an atomic process). In the first example, the outcome of the die 
        roll doesn't impact the drawing of a card -- these events are <em>independent</em>.
        In the second example, however, the result of the first card dealt does impact 
        the probabilities associated with what our second card will be -- the dealing 
        of these two cards are <em>dependent</em> events.

        Let's dig into the section to learn more and gain some practice.

    <p>
      Sometimes we are interested in the probabilities of outcomes associated with 
      several distinct processes. For example, we may want to know the probability 
      of being dealt an two Aces
