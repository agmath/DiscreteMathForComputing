  <title>Building a Base-Conversion Function</title>

  <introduction>
    <p><em>Note.</em> This section asks you to construct a 
    base-conversion function using computer code. There 
    are interactive code blocks included throughout the section, 
    where you are invited to  write your own from scratch. The 
    interactive code blocks exist to allow <c>Sage</c>, 
    <c>Python</c>, and <c>R</c>.
    </p>

    <p> In order to successfully navigate this Project, you'll 
    need to recall how base-conversion works (from Chapter 1). 
    You'll also need to use what we learned about logic and 
    how it can be used for programmatic flow control. That is, 
    you'll need to recall what we learned about <em>If/Then</em> 
    statements. You'll also need to make use of <c>for</c> 
    and <c>while</c> loops. This project is a great 
    opportunity to connect our discrete math content to the 
    topics you've been learning and implementing in your 
    introductory coding course.

    <p>Let's start with a function that converts decimal numbers 
    into their corresponding binary representations.
    <ul>
        <li> Start with a pseudocode outline for your function. 
        Pseudocode is a very high-level description of the steps a 
        program must complete, beginning with 0 or more inputs, 
        before returning a desired output. Write a pseudocode 
        description of this function.</li>
        <li> Choose your favorite programming language and try to 
        transform your pseudocode into a working function.</li>
    </ul>

    </sage>
    <ul>
        <li> Whether or not you've chosen to build a working version 
        of the function to take a decimal integer and convert it 
        into binary, think about whether your code/pseudocode will 
        handle special ("edge") cases. Is your function capable of 
        converting 0? Can it handle negative integers as inputs? How 
        does your function behave when you pass it a non-integer 
        value as an input? Try updating your code/pseudocode to 
        handle these things.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>Build a function which will convert a bit-string (binary 
    string) to its corresponding decimal representation.
    <ul>
        <li> Start with a pseudocode outline for the function.</li>
        <li> Try taking your pseudocode and implementing it as a 
        working function in your language of choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <sage language="sage">

    #Define your Sage function here

    <sage language="python">

    <sage language="r">
    <input>
    #Define your R function here
    </input>
    </sage>
    <ul>
        <li> Does your function "work" if you accidentally provide 
        it a non-binary input? We better update the function to 
        check this. We don't want users to get an output if they 
        don't provide a valid input. Make the corresponding update 
        to your function.</li>
        <li>Does your error check use a separate loop to ensure that 
        the user input is binary? If so, can you make your function 
        more efficient by using just a single loop? NOTE: We'll 
        return to the idea of looping and efficiency later in our 
        course.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p> Now that you've made it this far, maybe we don't want to 
    restrict ourselves to working only in binary. Make updates to 
    your previous two functions so that they can convert to and from 
    decimal representations and any other base less than 10. HINT: 
    You'll need to allow for users to input both the value to be 
    converted as well as the base you are working with in each 
    function.
    <ul>
        <li> Create a new version of your first function which will 
        convert a decimal integer to base-<m>b</m>, where 
        <m>2\leq b \lt 10</m>.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li> Create a new version of your second function which will 
        convert an integer written in base-<m>b</m>, where 
        <m>2\leq b \lt 10</m>, into its decimal representation.</li>

    </sage>
    <ul>
        <li> Check to ensure your functions handle "edge" cases, like 
        converting 0, dealing with negative integers, and checking to 
        ensure valid inputs before returning a converted value.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p> You now have all of the tools you need in order to piece 
    together a function that will convert between two bases <m>b_1</m> 
    and <m>b_2</m>, with <m>2\leq b_1, b_2 \leq 10</m>.
    <ul>
        <li> Build a new function, calling the functions you've written 
        so far as helpers, to convert between any two bases (as long 
        as those bases are at most base-10). Your function will need 
        three input values: <c>initial_value</c>, 
        <c>initial_base</c>, and <c>target_base</c>.</li>

    <p> As one more challenge, try building a function which will 
    convert a decimal integer value into its hexadecimal representation. 
    You'll get more practice with <c>if</c> / 
    <c>else if</c>, and <c>else</c> statements here.</p>
