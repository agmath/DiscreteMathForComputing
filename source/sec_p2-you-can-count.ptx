  <title>You Can Count! </title>

  <introduction>

    <p><em>Note.</em> This project does not require any coding.
    </p>

    <p>We spent a few weeks in our course covering some techniques for 
    counting. We saw that counting is not as simple as your elementary 
    school teachers made it seem - in fact, counting can be quite complex 
    and difficult! You'll explore some even more advanced counting 
    techniques in this project. This project includes the following 
    requirements.
    </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Read Section 2.5 of <a href="https://rellek.net/book/s_strings_bin-coeff.html"><em>Applied Combinatorics</em>, 
    by Mitch Keller and Tom Trotter</a>.</li>
    <li> Provide your own synopsis of the section, including how it 
    extends our ability to count beyond those applications we considered 
    in our class discussions.</li>
    <li> Provide detailed discussions and solutions of problems 15, 16, 
    and 24 from the Chapter Exercises.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Topic Expectations.</em> A complete submission for this topic will 
  include solutions to all three of the problems mentioned in the topic 
  description above. Solutions alone, however, are not enough to earn 
  full credit for the assignment. The quality of your synopses of the 
  required readings as well as your discussions around the solutions to 
  the problems is of primary importance. In particular, you should write 
  your paper so that someone in our class could read and understand how 
  to use these new counting techniques, and understand how you approached 
  the problems.
