  <introduction>
    <p>In progress. We don't intend for much to be included here, since 
    the Project III chapter which follows asks the reader to research a 
    topic in graph theory. This chapter will eventually include the 
    following sections covering very basic background.
    <ul>
      <li> Introduction to Graph Theory</li>
      <li> Special Classes of Graph</li>
    </ul>
    The example below shows how to embed tikz graphs into a PreTeXt document.
