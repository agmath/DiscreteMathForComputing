  <title>Arrangements and Permutations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this section we encounter methods for counting the number of 
    <em>arrangements</em> (or <em>orderings</em>) of items selected from a 
    collection of options. Unlike the previous section, we do not allow 
    items to be selected more than once here. You might think of choosing 
    the way in which people line up for a photograph as your paradigm here.
    In fact, that's the context with which we'll motivate our discussion 
    below.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection><title>Motivation</title>
    <p>Consider the context of families lining up for a wedding photo. The
    bride's family has 5 people (including her) and the goom's family has 
    4 people (including him). Perhaps we want to know the total number of 
    ways these individuals could line up (left to right) for a photograph.
    </p>

    <p>There are lots of restrictions we could impose on the ordering. Let's 
    see several examples below.
    </p>

    <example xml:id = "photo-lineup-ex"> <title>A Wedding Photo, Part I</title>
      <statement>The families described above would like to line up to take
      a photograph together. In the spirit of the marriage and becoming one 
      large family, there are no restrictions on the lineup and who is standing
      next to one another. In how many ways can the individuals in this photo
      be arranged from left to right?
      </statement>
      <answer><p>Notice that there will be 9 total people in the photograph -- 
      the five total members of the bride's family and the four total members of
      the groom's family. We can think of the photo lineup using the "picture" 
      below.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~</mrow></md>
      <p>Because nobody has been positioned yet, there are 9 individuals who 
      could be placed into the left-most position.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>~9~~\cdot~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~</mrow></md>
      <p>Once that first person has been placed, there are only eight individuals
      left to position. That is, for any choice of the person to place into the 
      leftmost position, there are eight choices of person to place next to them. 
      The Fundamental Principle of Counting then suggests that there are <m>9\cdot 8</m>
      ways to arrange people into the two leftmost positions.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>~9~~\cdot~~8~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~</mrow></md>
      <p>Continuing in this fashion, there are seven individuals to place in the 
      next position, followed by six for the one after, continuing on until we are 
      left with only the last person to place into that final position.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>~9~~\cdot~~8\cdot~~7~~\cdot~~6~~\cdot~~5~~\cdot~~4~~\cdot~~3~~\cdot~~2~~\cdot~~1</mrow></md>
      <p>Multiplying, we obtain <m>\boxed{~362,880~}</m> total arrangements for that one 
      photo!
      </p>
      </answer>
    </example>

    <definition><title>Factorial</title>
      <statement>The product <m>9\cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot\cdots\cdot 2\cdot 1</m> used 
        above is a type of product that appears so often in mathematics that it is 
        given a special name and notation. That product can be read as <em>9 factorial</em>
        and is often denoted as <m>9!</m>. In general, <em>n factorial</em> is written
        as
        <md>
          <mrow>n! = n\cdot\left(n-1\right)\cdot\left(n-2\right)\cdot\cdots\cdot \left(2\right)\cdot\left(1\right)</mrow>
        </md>
      </statement> 
    </definition>

    <p>Let's explore some more restrictive versions of our wedding photo arrangement.
    </p>

    <example><title>A Wedding Photo, Part II</title>
      <statement>Assume that we want a photo where the bride and groom 
      are positioned in the center of the photo, with the groom to the left of the bride, 
      the groom's family to the left of the groom, and the bride's family to the right of 
      the bride. How many different arrangements of the individuals for the photo satisfy
      these requirements?
      </statement>
      <answer><p>This photograph is more restrictive than the previous one. Because of this 
      we should expect that there are fewer arrangements resulting in an acceptable photo.
      Since the groom's family should be to the left of the groom and the bride's family to 
      the right of the bride, we know that the groom must occupy the position fourth from 
      the left and the bride must occupy the position fifth from the left. Let's start with
      such an arrangement. We'll let G stand for the groom and B stand for the bride.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~G~~B~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}</mrow></md> 
      <p>Notice that there is no choice in the placement we just made. There is exactly one
      way to have the groom occupy the fourth position from the left and the bride occupy 
      the fifth position. We do have some choice in how to fill in the remaining positions 
      though.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\underbrace{\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}}_{\text{Groom's Family}}~~G~~B~~\underbrace{\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}}_{\text{Bride's family}}</mrow></md>
      <p>Now, since there are three remaining members of the groom's family, we have three 
      options for who will occupy the leftmost position, two who will occupy the next position
      and then the final member of the groom's family will fill in the position just to the 
      left of the groom.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\underbrace{\underline{~3~}~\cdot~\underline{~2~}~\cdot~\underline{~1~}}_{\text{Groom's Family}}~~G~~B~~\underbrace{\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}}_{\text{Bride's family}}</mrow></md>
      <p>Similarly, we can fill in the positions to the right of the bride. We need only 
      remember that there are four additional members of her family.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\underbrace{\underline{~3~}~\cdot~\underline{~2~}~\cdot~\underline{~1~}}_{\text{Groom's Family}}~~G~~B~~\underbrace{\underline{~4~}~\cdot~\underline{~3~}~\cdot~\underline{~2~}~\cdot~\underline{~1~}}_{\text{Bride's family}}</mrow></md>
      <p>Recalling that there was no choice in how the bride and groom were positioned, we 
      use the Fundamental Principle of Counting to compute the total number of arrangements
      for the photo.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\left(3\cdot 2\cdot 1\right)\cdot\left(4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1\right) = \boxed{~144~}</mrow></md>
      <p>Adding those additional restrictions drastically reduced the number of acceptable 
      arrangements for the photo. We went from <m>362,880</m> arrangements for the unrestriced 
      photo to only <m>144</m> arrangements for the photo with these restrictions!
      </p>
      </answer>
    </example>

    <p>What if not everyone needs to be in the photo? Perhaps the photographer wants a 
    random subset of six individuals for the photo. Consider the example below, which 
    introduces the notion of <em>permutations</em>. After this, you'll have an opportunity
    to practice what you've learned!
    </p>

    <example><title>A Wedding Photo, Part III</title>
      <statement>The wedding photographer has set up a photo booth which can accommodate
      six people at a time. In how many ways can six members of the wedding party arrange 
      themselves (left to right) for a photo in the photo booth?
      </statement>
      <answer><p>While there aren't positional restrictions on this photo, there is a size 
      restriction. Not all of the nine family members will be able to be in the picture.
      That being said, the approach is still the same. We have six positions to fill.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}</mrow></md> 
      <p>We'll fill each of the positions above. All nine of the family members are available
      to fill the leftmost position. 
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\underline{~9~}~\cdot~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}~~\underline{~~~}</mrow></md> 
      <p>Once the family member has been chosen to take the leftmost position, there are
      eight faily members available for the next, and so on until all of the positions 
      have been filled.
      </p>
      <md><mrow>\underline{~9~}~\cdot~\underline{~8~}~\cdot~\underline{~7~}~\cdot~\underline{~6~}~\cdot~\underline{~5~}~\cdot~\underline{~4~}</mrow></md> 
      <p>Notice that all of the positions for the photo have been filled. The remaining 
      three family members will not be in the photo, so their positional order does 
      not matter. The total number of arrangements for a family photo in the photo 
      booth are
      </p>
      <md><mrow>9\cdot\left(8\right)\cdot\left(7\right)\cdot\left(6\right)\cdot\left(5\right)\cdot\left(4\right) = \boxed{~60,480~}~</mrow></md>
      <p>That is, there are 60,480 different arrangements for the photo booth photo 
      which will include six of the nine family members.
      </p>
      </answer>
    </example>

    <p>As with factorials, the type of product we used above (a factorial with its 
    tail end cut off) appears commonly in mathematics and is referred to as a 
    <em>permutation</em>. A definition appears below.
    </p>

    <definition><title>Permutation</title>
      <statement>A <em>permutation</em> of <m>k</m> elements from a collection of 
      size <m>n</m>, where <m>k\leq n</m>, counts the number of ways to arrange 
      (order) those <m>k</m> elements. The notation and definition for a permutation
      of <m>k</m> elements from a collection of <m>n</m> appears below:
      <md><mrow>_n P_k = \frac{n!}{\left(n - k\right)!} = n\cdot\left(n - 1\right)\cdot\cdots\cdot\left(n - \left(k-1\right)\right)</mrow></md>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    of factorials and permutations, use what you've learned to solve the
    embedded exercises below.

    <conclusion>In this section you discovered and applied the factorial as a
    mathematical operation which counts the number of ways we can arrange <m>n</m>
    elements into an ordering. Additionally, you saw and applied permutations 
    as a way to arrange a subset of a collection of objects into an ordering
    where not all of the objects in the collection are utilized. In the next 
    section, we'll discover how to count the number of ways to <em>select</em> 
    a subset of items from a collection when the order of selection does not
    matter.
