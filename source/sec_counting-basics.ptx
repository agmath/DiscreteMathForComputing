  <title>Basic Counting Techniques</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this section we discover some fundamental counting techniques
    which will provide us a foundation to build upon. You'll encounter 
    some scenarios in which addition is utilized to count a number of 
    objects/possibilities as well as other scenarios in which 
    multiplication is utilized. You'll identify how to determine which 
    approach should be applied in a given scenario and you'll apply 
    your chosen method to carry out the counting.</p>

    <title>Counting Outcomes of Atomic Processes</title>

    <introduction> Throughout this short subsection, we'll use the phrase <em>atomic 
    processes</em> to describe processes which cannot be decomposed into 
    smaller, sub-processes. Examples of these atomic processes 
    are the flip of a coin or a roll of a single die. This is as opposed 
    to a more complex process like the rolling of a pair of dice, the flipping 
    of multiple coins, or a combination of die rolls and coin flips. In these 
    more complex cases, we can break the corresponding process into two or 
    more <em>atomic processes</em>. For example, rolling a pair of dice 
    consists of two atomic processes -- the roll of the first die and the 
    roll of the second.
    </introduction>

    <p> Verify your understanding of <em>atomic processes</em> versus more 
    complex processes by answering the following embedded exercise.

    </exercise>

    <p> Were you comfortable with classifying those processes? The convenient 
    thing about what we've classified as atomic processes is that the number 
    of outcomes possible from an atomic process is simple to count. Indeed, 
    the number of outcomes possible on a single flip of a coin is two -- we 
    can observe a <em>heads</em> or a <em>tails</em> as the outcome. Verify 
    this by counting the number of outcomes possible for each of the atomic 
    processes in the embedded exercise below.

    <p> Good work. In the next subsection and the following section in this 
    chapter, we'll use what we know about counting the number of outcomes from 
    atomic processes to help us count the number of outcomes of more complex 
    processes with multiple components.

  <subsection>
    <title>Near-Atomic Processes: One <em>or</em> the Other(s)</title>

    <introduction> In this subsection, we consider processes which ultimately consist of 
    just a single action but where there is a choice or uncertainty about 
    which action will be taken. For example, we might consider the opportunity 
    to flip a coin <em>or</em> roll of a six-sided die. In this case, we either 
    flipe the coin or roll the die, but we don't do both. In this case, there 
    are two possible outcomes if we flip the coin and an additional six outcomes 
    possible if we roll the die. In total, there are eight (8) outcomes possible 
    from this process.
    </introduction>

    <p> We consider the process above a <em>near-atomic process</em> because we 
    can't quite break it into smaller sub-processes because only one of these 
    sub-processes will actually be enacted. In this case, the total number of 
    outcomes possible is the sum of the number of outcomes possible from each 
    component process. That is, we obtained 8 total outcomes possible in the 
    example above because there were two outcomes associated with the coin flip 
    and six outcomes associated with the die roll. Since we were either flipping 
    the coin <em>or</em> rolling the die, we added the two totals together. 
    </p> 

    <p> Test your grasp of what constitutes a near-atomic process by completing 
    this next interactive exercise.

    <p> Test your understanding of counting the possible number of outcomes from 
    near-atomic processes in the interactive exercise below.

    <p> As you worked through those last two exercises, make note of where you 
    were confident as well as where you stumbled or were less sure of yourself. 
    Be sure to ask questions on the items where you were less sure of yourself.

  </subsection>

      <p> Good work through this introductory section on counting. See you in the 
    section, where we'll be introduced to the <em>Fundamental Principle of 
    Counting</em> which will allow us to count the number of outcomes possible 
    for non-atomic, complex processes where the several component processes are 
    all completed. That is, rather than choosing to flip a coin <em>or</em> roll 
    a die, we'll flip the coin <em>and</em> roll the die.
