  <title>Basic Counting Techniques</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this section we discover some fundamental counting techniques
    which will provide us a foundation to build upon. You'll encounter 
    some scenarios in which addition is utilized to count a number of 
    objects/possibilities as well as other scenarios in which 
    multiplication is utilized. You'll identify how to determine which 
    approach should be applied in a given scenario and you'll apply 
    your chosen method to carry out the counting.</p>
  </introduction>

  <p> I'm envisioning a series of interactive problems to make up the 
  bulk of this section. Sample exercises are described below. I'll 
  write dynamic versions into MyOpenMath soon and embed them into the 
  text. 
  <ol>
    <li>A single character password is to be chosen over an approved 
    <em>alphabet</em> of characters. How many unique passwords are 
    possible?</li>
    <li>A single character password is to be chosen over an approved 
    alphabet of characters or a selected set of symbols. How many 
    unique passwords are possible?</li>
    <li>A single character password is to be chosen over an approved 
    alphabet of characters, selected set of symbols, or the digits 
    0 - 9. How many unique passwords are possible?</li>
    <li>A two-character password is to be chosen...</li>
    <li> etc.</li>
  </ol>
