			<title>About This Text</title>
			
			<p>This interactive, IBL, text was designed for use in a first-year
			 course in Discrete Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University. 
			 The course is designed for students taking a first semester of discrete 
			 mathematics in conjunction with an introductory programming course. 
			 Discrete mathematics content is introduced in time for it to be utilized 
			 in the corrsponding programming class.</p>
			
			<p>At Southern New Hampshire University, first-semester Computer Science 
			students take CS113 (an introductory course in C++) and also traditionally 
			took a course in Discrete Mathematics designed for general education 
			purposes. In 2020, this Discrete Mathematics course was phased out and was 
			replaced by a Discrete Mathematics for Computing course. Topics from the 
			original Discrete Mathematics course were rearranged such that they are 
			covered in time to be used in the CS113 class. Because the course is 
			advertised as a mathematics <i>for computing</i> course, connections are 
			explicitly made between mathematics and programming concepts.</p>
			
			<p>Since the course has been developed, students majoring in Information 
			Technology and students majoring in Game Programming have been encouraged 
			by their major faculty to enroll as well. Those programs utilize Python and 
			C#, respectively, in their first-semester coursework. For these reasons, 
			we've attempted to build the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course (and 
			this accompanying text) as "language agnostic" experiences. A table of 
			aligned coverage for the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course and the 
			corresponding first-semester programming coursework in the partner programs 
			appears below.</p>
