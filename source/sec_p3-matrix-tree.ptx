  <title>The Matrix-Tree Theorem</title>

  <introduction>
    <p><em>Note.</em> This project can be completing with or without 
    coding. However, this project does require some exposure to linear 
    algebra. In particular, you should know what a <em>determinant</em> 
    is prior to choosing this project.

    <p><em>The Matrix-Tree Theorem.</em> The matrix tree theorem uses 
    matrix determinants to find the number of spanning trees in a graph. 
    In practice, this could help you find - for instance - the number of 
    routes a postal worker could take to deliver mail to every house in a 
    neighborhood. You should talk about what graphs and spanning trees 
    are, how to encode a graph in a matrix, and then show how to find the 
    number of spanning trees on a small graph.
