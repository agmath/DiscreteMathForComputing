    <p><em>Graph Pebbling.</em> Consider a graph in which a non-negative 
    integer number of currency (pebbles) are placed at each vertex. That 
    is, some vertices may have no pebbles, while others have a positive 
    whole number of pebbles. The goal of graph pebbling is to carry at 
    least one pebble to a target vertex that begins with no pebbles. 
    Each time a stack of pebbles is moved along an edge, a 50% "tax" 
    must be paid. That is, if you move a stack of 6 pebbles from a vertex 
    to one of its neighbors, only 3 pebbles arrive at the neighbor, and 
    the other three are lost. Similarly, if a stack of 9 pebbles are 
    moved, only 4 will remain (there is no way to make "change" in 
    pebbling). 
    </p>

    <p>The <em>pebbling number</em> of a graph is the smallest number of 
    pebbles such that any (even the most diabolical) initial configuration 
    and choice of target is "pebblable". As part of this project, you will 
    find the pebbling numbers for several classes of graph, including 
    complete graphs, paths, and cycles. Glen Hurlbert's
