  <title>Networks</title>

  <introduction>
    <p><em>Note.</em> This project can be completing with or without 
    coding.

    <p><em>Networks.</em> Networks encode real-world relationships into 
    graphs. Your project should give examples of networks (be sure to 
    explain what your vertices and edges represent!), and should discuss 
    and explain various centrality measures including degree centrality 
    and betweeness centrality. You should also mention eigenvector 
    centrality and what it measures, though unless you have taken linear
    algebra, you do not need to talk about how to find it.
