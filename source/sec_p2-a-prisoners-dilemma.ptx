  <title>A Prisoners' Dilemma</title>

  <introduction>
    <p><em>Note.</em> This project can be completing with or without 
    coding. Part 3 of the project is difficult without coding.
    </p>

    <p>You are locked in a tower of a Medieval castle with three fellow 
    captives (i.e., there are four captured persons in total), each in 
    an isolated cell with no opportunity to communicate.
    </p>

    <p>The guards have decided to give you all a single chance for 
    immediate release. They invite you and your three fellow captives to 
    partake in a game of chance. Provide your analysis of the best 
    strategy under the following individual game scenarios. Given your 
    strategy, what is the probability of escaping the tower?
    </p>

    <p> In your analysis, please remember that you may not consult with 
    your fellow captives (not even prior to the game commencing), nor 
    will they be able to communicate with one another, and you will not 
    be able to learn the choice made or result obtained by any of the 
    captives participating before you.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Each captive will be given a fair die, which they can 
        either decide to roll or simply return to the guards without 
        rolling. If the sum of the rolls is at least 8, then you will 
        all be released without question, but if the total of the rolls 
        is less than 8, you will all remain imprisoned in the castle 
        tower for the rest of your days.</li>
        <li> Each captive will be given a fair coin, which they then can 
        either decide to flip or simply return to the guards without 
        flipping. If all flipped coins come up tails, you will all be 
        released without question, but if any of the flipped coins show 
        heads, or if none of you flip the coin, you will all remain 
        imprisoned in the castle tower for the rest of your days.</li>
        <li> Each captive will be given a fair die, which each captive 
        can either decide to roll or simply return to the guards without 
        rolling. If all rolls result in an odd number of pips facing 
        upwards, then you will all be released without question, but if 
        any single roll turns up an even number, or if none of you choose 
        to roll, you will all remain imprisoned in the castle tower for 
        the rest of your days.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The only tools you and your fellow prisoners have to aid you are 
    random number generators, which will give each prisoner a random 
    number, uniformly and independently chosen between zero and one (i.e. 
    you could get .25 or .64, etc on this number generator). These random 
    number generators may be a helpful tool in making individual decisions 
    about whether to play or pass. As part of your strategy, though you 
    cannot decide beforehand who will play and who will pass, you can 
    decide a number from the random number generator that will be a 
    threshold below which a prisoner will play, and above which they will 
    pass.
    </p>

    <p><em>Topic Expectations.</em> Regardless of whether or not you use 
    code, you should do part (1).
    <ul>
        <li> If you do NOT use code, then for parts (2) and (3), give 
        your best estimate of what your threshold with the random number 
        generator should be. Explain why you think that threshold would 
        work best.</li>
        <li> If you DO use code, then for parts (2) and (3), use a 
        simulation to determine what the threshold for the random number 
        generator should be. Please include your code as an appendix, and 
        explain why the number your code generates makes sense.
        </li>
    </ul>
