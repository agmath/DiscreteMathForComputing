  <introduction>
    <p>In the final two chapters of our course we encountered 
    arrays and got a quick introduction to graph theory. In our
    chapter on arrays we encountered both one-dimensional arrays 
    (vectors), and multidimensional arrays (matrices and tensors). 
    In our chapter on graph theory, we developed the notion of a 
    graph as a network of nodes, potentially connected via edges. 
    We saw that graphs find many uses in computing. They serve as 
    models for everything from database design, to file systems, or 
    social networks.</p>

    <p>If you continue along with computing coursework, you'll 
    encounter both arrays and graph structures often throughout 
    your studies. Arrays are a very common linear data structure, 
    and many non-linear data structures are analogous to graphs.
    </p>

    <p>You'll find opportunities to explore more about graphs and 
    arrays in this final chapter worth of project ideas. Some of
    the projects proposed in the sections that follow come from 
    open areas of research in graph theory, while others invite 
    the reader to explor an interesting application of graph 
    theory. We hope you'll find something that piques your interest!
