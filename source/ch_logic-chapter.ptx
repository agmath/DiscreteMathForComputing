  <introduction>
    <p>A draft version of this chapter is complete, however it still has several 
    needs. For example, a greater variety of MyOpenMath problems need to be 
    written and then embedded into the text. There are several placeholder 
    checkpoint exercises now, but those will eventually swapped out for more 
    dynamic versions of problems in the future. The following outline the 
    primary needs:
      <ul>
        <li> In Section 3.1, more examples of identifying statements are needed. 
        I'll have to plan out how to randomly produce samples using MyOpenMath 
        macros. This is doable with random selection and arrays, but it will 
        take some thinking to ensure that the structure of the generated 
        statements is not identical. </li>
        <li> In Section 3.2, I want randomly generated logical statements and 
        dynamically created truth tables in the MyOpenMath problems. I think 
        this is doable with conditional statements, but I have questions about
        the problem displays. Look to some of the matrix problems I've written 
        for linear algebra where the size of the answer matrix is dynamic. A 
        similar solution should work here.</li>
        <li> In Section 3.3, problems need to be written. Look at Doug Ensley's 
        <em>Boolean Proof</em> problems. Writing problems similar to these will 
        be a reasonable first pass.</li>
      </ul>
