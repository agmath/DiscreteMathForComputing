  <title>Operations with Sets</title>
<p> In the previous section we were introduced to the notion of a set, its 
elements, the cardinality of a finite set, the notion of subsets, and also the 
notion of equality between sets. In this section, we'll be introduced to four 
common operations on sets. 
<ul>
  <li> The <em>complement</em> of a set, denoted by <m>A^c</m> or <m>A'</m>.</li>
  <li> The <em>intersection</em> between two sets, denoted by <m>A\cap B</m>.</li>
  <li> The <em>union</em> between two sets, denoted by <m>A\cup B</m>.</li>
  <li> The <em>difference</em> between two sets, denoted by <m>A - B</m>.</li>
</ul>
</p>  

<p> Given a set <m>A</m> in some universal set <m>U</m>, we can define the 
<em>complement of <m>A</m> in <m>U</m></em> to be the collection of all 
elements which are in the universal set <m>U</m> but not in the set <m>A</m>. 
We denote the complement of the set <m>A</m> by <m>A^c</m> or <m>A'</m>. 
</p>

<p> Given two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we can define the <em>intersection 
between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m></em> as the collection of elements which are in 
<em>both</em> the set <m>A</m> and also the set <m>B</m>. We use the notation 
<m>A\cap B</m> to denote the intersection between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

<p> Given two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we can define the <em>union 
between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m></em> as the collection of elements which are in 
<em>at least on of</em> the set <m>A</m> or the set <m>B</m>. We use the notation 
<m>A\cup B</m> to denote the union between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

<p>In addition to computing unions and intersections over pairs of sets, we can combine 
these operations to created new sets. Like in your prior exposure to arithmetic 
and algebra, parentheses can be used to dictate the order in which operations are 
to be evaluated. In the absence of parentheses, the complement is evaluated before 
unions and intersections. Then unions and intersections are evaluated from left to 
right.

<p>Now that you've mastered the union, the intersection, and the complement. 
Let's see our last set operation, the set difference. Given two sets <m>A</m> and 
<m>B</m>, the set difference is denoted by <m>A - B</m>, and is the set consisting 
of all elements of <m>A</m> which are not elements of <m>B</m>. That is, to find 
the set <m>A - B</m>, we begin with all of the elements of <m>A</m> and remove 
any elements which also appear in <m>B</m>.
