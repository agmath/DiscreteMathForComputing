  <title>Converting from Base-10 to Non-Standard Bases</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In the previous section, we considered that representation of 
    numbers using bases other than the base-10 (decimal) system is 
    possible, and sometimes necessary. In that section you considered 
    the true meaning of <em>place-value</em> and built on your 
    intuitive understanding to identify a scheme for converting an 
    integer, written in any non-standard base, into its decimal-
    equivalent.</p>

    <p>In this section, we'll work in the opposite direction. Say we
    have a decimal represresentation of a value. How do we identify 
    or construct its base-<m>b</m> equivalent?</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection><title>Developing a Strategy</title>
    <p>THIS SECTION WILL NEED LOTS OF EDITING -- just getting a 
    "working version" up for now.</p>

    <p>In order to convert a value whose decimal representation is 
    <m>n</m> into its corresponding base-<m>b</m> equivalent, we 
    need to first identify the number of whole copies of <m>b</m> 
    which divide evenly into <m>n</m>. The left over amount (you've 
    likely called this the <em>remainder</em> when discussing division
    in your previous math courses) will be the <em>singles</em> digit 
    in the base-<m>b</m> representation of <m>n</m>.</p>

    <p>Let's consider an example, which we'll parse throughout this 
    discussion. Consider the decimal value <m>n = 113</m>, for which 
    we'll try to discover its base-<m>3</m> equivalent. The paragraph 
    above suggests that we should start by identifying the number of 
    "whole copies" of <m>3</m> which divide evenly into <m>113</m>. 
    Notice that <m>3\cdot 37 = 111</m>, so there are <m>37</m> "whole" 
    copies of <m>3</m> within the decimal value <m>113</m>, with a 
    remainder of <m>2</m>. That is, <m>113 = 3\cdot \left(37\right) + 
    2</m>, and <m>2</m> will occupy the singles-digit in the 
    base-<m>3</m> representation of <m>113</m>.</p> 

    <p>How can we identify the next digit to the left in the 
    base-<m>3</m> representation of <m>113</m>? That digit will be 
    the remainder after considering the number of whole copies of 
    <m>3^2</m> within the decimal value <m>113</m>, after accounting
    for the singles digit. That is, the digit occupying the second 
    place-value will be the remainder after considering the number 
    of whole copies of <m>9</m> which divide evenly into <m>\left(
    114 - 2\right)</m>. More simply, we could consider the remainder 
    after <m>3</m> is divided into <m>37</m> -- the quotient from the 
    previous step. From here, we note that <m>37 = 3\cdot
    \left(12\right) + 1</m>, and so the digit occupying the second 
    position will be <m>1</m>.</p>

    <p>Identifying the digit occupying the remaining positions is 
    similar. The next digit will be the remainder, when dividing 
    <m>3</m> into the quotient from the previous step (here, that
    value was <m>12</m>). Since <m>12 = 3\cdot \left(4\right) + 0</m>,
    the digit occupying the third position from the right is <m>0</m>. 
    Similarly, the digit occupying the next position is the remainder 
    after <m>3</m> is divided into <m>4</m> (again, using the previous
    quotient). Since <m>4 = 3\cdot\left(1\right) + 1</m>, the digit 
    occupying that fourth position is <m>1</m>. Finally, the leftmost 
    digit will be the remainder when this quotient (<m>1</m>) is 
    divided by the desired base (here, <m>3</m>). So we have 
    <m>1 = 3\cdot \left(0\right) + 1</m>, and the leftmost digit is 
    <m>1</m>. To summarize, we've discovered that 
    <m>\left(113\right)_{10} = \left(11012\right)_{3}</m>.</p>

    <p>Let's describe the process above before summarizing with a 
    more concise version of the procedure. If we wish to find the 
    base-<m>b</m> equivalent representation of the decimal integer 
    <m>n</m>, we write
      <me>n = b\cdot q_{0} + r_{0}, \text{ where } 0 \leq r_{0} \lt b</me>
    Next, we rewrite <m>q_{0}</m> in the same fashion.
      <me>q_{0} = b\cdot q_{1} + r_{1}, \text{ where } 0 \leq r_{1} \lt b</me>
    We continue this while the quotients, <m>q_{i}</m> are non-zero.
    Once we arrive at a quotient <m>q_{k} = 0</m>, the process 
    terminates and we use the remainders to write the base-<m>b</m> 
    representation <m>\left(r_{k}r_{k-1}\cdots r_{1}r_{0}\right)_{b}</m> 
    of our original <m>n</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>We recap the process of constructing the base-<m>3</m> 
    equivalent of <m>\left(113\right)_{10}</m> below.
      <md>
        <mrow>113 \amp = 3\cdot 37 + 2</mrow>
        <mrow>37 \amp = 3\cdot 12 + 1</mrow>
        <mrow>12 \amp = 3\cdot 4 + 0</mrow>
        <mrow>4 \amp = 3\cdot 1 + 1</mrow>
        <mrow>1 \amp = 3\cdot 0 + 1</mrow>
      </md>
    
    At the last line, we arrive at a quotient of <m>0</m>, so we 
    terminate the procedure. The base-<m>3</m> encoding of 
    <m>\left(113\right)_{10}</m> is given by <m>\left(11012\right)_{3}</m>,
    reading the remainders from the last line back up to the first.

  <subsection><title>Let's Try It!</title>
    <p>Now that we've developed a strategy for writing the base-<m>b</m> 
    equivalent of a given decimal integer, let's get more comfortable 
    using it. In this section, you'll have a variety of opportunities 
    to work through our algorithm. You'll have lots of support through 
    the initial examples, but we'll provide less and less structure 
    with each successive task.

    <p> Now that you've converted from decimal to binary a few times, let's 
    work with some other bases. In the examples that follow, the bases 
    we want to convert to will change but your strategy remains the same.</p>
