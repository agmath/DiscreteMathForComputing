    <p><em>Graph Algorithms.</em> We spent the last day of class content 
    talking about finding spanning trees. This project will focus on 
    algorithms to find spanning trees if the edges are weighted (a much 
    more realistic scenario). This project should address three different 
    algorithms: Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm, which each find 
    minimum spanning trees, and Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the 
    shortest path between nodes. You should discuss what a minimum spanning 
    tree is, and what is meant by a shortest path. You should also explain 
    what each algorithm does, as well as explaining why each algorithm 
    works and giving an example of each.
