  <title>Multidimensional Arrays</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In the first two sections of this chapter on arrays, we've encountered 
    one-dimensional arrays (sometimes referred to as vectors), and 
    two-dimensional arrays (often referred to as matrices). Arrays are 
    important structures in mathematics and also in computing. We've spent 
    our time focused on operations which can be done with arrays and some 
    example implementations of algorithms that compute those operations. We've 
    ignored the technical aspects of arrays from a computer science perspective 
    since you'll get that exposure in computer science coursework. 
    </p>

    <p>Before we exit this chapter, its worth mentioning that multidimensional 
    arrays (arrays with more than just rows and columns) exist and find lots of 
    uses in the real world. For example, a three-dimensional array is requird to 
    define the colors of the pixels on your computer monitor right now. You can 
    think of such an array as containing a matrix for the <em>red</em> channel, 
    another matrix for the <em>green</em> channel, and a third matrix for the 
    <em>blue</em> channel. Perhaps there is a fourth matrix governing the opacity 
    (equivalently, the level of transparency) of the pixel. This is often referred 
    to as an <em>alpha</em> channel. 
    </p>

    <p>These multidimensional arrays find uses elsewhere too. Perhaps you've heard 
    of machine learning, where some classes of model, like <em>Long Short-Term 
    Memory</em> (LSTM) models, require these multidimensional arrays (sometimes 
    called <em>tensors</em>) as inputs. Arrays are important data structures, and 
    you'll be making lots of use of them in your future coursework and computing 
    endeavours.
