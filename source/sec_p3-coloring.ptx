    <p><em>Note.</em> This project can be completing with or without

    <p><em>Graph Colorings.</em> In this project, students will explore 
    the rules and properties of graph colorings. In particular, you'll 
    focus on vertex colorings of graphs in both solitary and competitive 
    cases.
    <ul>
        <li>Define what is meant by a vertex coloring of a graph, a proper 
        coloring of a graph, and the chromatic number of a graph. Find the 
        chromatic number of a path, a tree, a cycle, and a complete graph.</li>
        <li> Use this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring_game">
        Wikipedia article</a> to learn a bit about the vertex coloring game 
        and the game chromatic number of a graph. Be sure to provide your 
        understanding of the game chromatic number and this competitive 
        approach to vertex coloring. Find the game chromatic number of a 
        path on <m>n</m> vertices.</li>
        <li> Consider a competitive coloring game, called Achievement, in 
        which two players alternate turns coloring a path on n vertices 
        with a single color. Players must color according to proper 
        coloring rules. The goal of the game is to be the last player to 
        properly color a vertex along the path. Explore the Achievement 
        game on paths of varying lengths. Can you identify whether it is
        better to be the first or second player to color a vertex in this 
        game? What strategies can you identify to guarantee that your 
        choice (of going first or second) will end in you winning? On which 
        types of paths does your winning strategy work?</li>
    </ul>
