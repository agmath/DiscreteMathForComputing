  <introduction>
    <p>In progress. Will include the following sections.
    <ul>
      <li> Counting Basics</li>
      <li> Counting Permutations</li>
      <li> Counting Selections Using Binomial Coefficients</li>
      <li> The Fundamental Principle of Counting</li>
      <li> Big-O Notation and Run-Time Complexity</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <!-- Sections can be written directly here, but it might help  -->
  <!-- with organization to include them as separate files.      -->
  <!-- That way it is easy to include the section in a different -->
