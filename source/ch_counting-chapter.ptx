    <p>A first draft of this chapter is complete. It should be in a condition
      suitable for student use. Additional improvements will be made over time.
      Priority improvements include:
      <ul>
        <li>Editing the narrative for clarity, brevity, and consistency.</li>
        <li>Creating and including additonal embedded MyOpenMath exercises.</li>
        <li>Including some slightly more advanced techniques using an inquiry-based approach.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <!-- Sections can be written directly here, but it might help  -->
  <!-- with organization to include them as separate files.      -->
  <!-- That way it is easy to include the section in a different -->
  <!-- chapter later if you change your mind about the order.    -->
