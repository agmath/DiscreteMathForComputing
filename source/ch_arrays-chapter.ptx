  <introduction>
    <p>Welcome to our next chapter, on arrays. In short, arrays are a 
    structure for storing data. You've almost surely encountered arrays 
    in your prior math or physics classes. Vectors are a special type 
    array -- vectors are assumed to be elements of an orientable space, 
    in which direction and magnitude are meaningful. Matrices are 
    another example of an array from your previous math courses -- 
    matrices are 2-dimensional arrays (they have both rows and columns), 
    while vectors are 1-dimensional. It is even possible to have arrays 
    which are multidimensional. Such an example are the current RGB 
    values of pixels arranged on your computer monitor. Each pixel has 
    corresponding red, green, and blue values. The result is a 
    3-dimensional array, which can be visualized as three matrices 
    positioned one behind the other.
    </p>

    <p>Like in mathematics, arrays as a computing object are structures 
    for storing data. Arrays carry the restriction that the data stored 
    within them must all be of the same type. For example, all integer 
    values, all floats, all strings, etc. We'll spend some time over the 
    next few sections of this book exploring these structures and 
    operations which can be done with them. We'll leave the technical 
    details about how arrays are stored in memory to your computing 
    courses, instead we will focus on mathematical operations with 
    arrays.
