  <title>Sample Project Guidelines</title>

  <introduction>
    <p><em>Note.</em> These are sample project guidelines that we've 
    provided to our students when offering this course at SNHU. We offer 
    them here in case they are helpful.
    </p>
    </introduction>

    <p><em>Requirements.</em> Pick a project from the topics described in 
    the sections of this chapter. Your completed project should include 
    the following.
    <ol>
        <li><em>Relevant Definitions</em>: Be sure to define all of the 
        terms you are using, unless we have specifically addressed that 
        term in our course.</li>
        <li><em>Explanation</em>: What is the topic trying to address? If 
        you are using formulas or algorithms, why do they work? This 
        should be the bulk of your project.</li>
        <li><em>Example</em>: Demonstrate with at least one example. You 
        should explain each step in your example(s). Your example(s) also 
        needs to be original. This means that you cannot use the exact same 
        example that your sources used in their descriptions.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p><em>Format.</em> This project could be:
    <ul>
        <li> a paper</li>
        <li> a poster</li>
        <li> a slide deck with video presentation</li>
        <li> a website</li>
        <li> for the game topics, can be a coded interactive game with 
        written description</li>
        <li> different modalities are possible, reach out to propose an 
        idea</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
 
    <p><em>Logistics.</em> Please pay attention to the following 
    requirements.
    <ul>
        <li>Your project should be as detailed as necessary to suffiently 
        explain your topic.</li>
        <li>You must have a bibliography including at least three sources. 
        You may use whatever citation style you want, but you MUST cite 
        every source that you use for the project. You may use Wikipedia as 
        <em>one</em> of your sources (but only one). You can also use the 
        textbook as one of your sources if applicable.</li>
        <li>You should take special care with communication in your project; 
        your project must be understandable by someone else in the class who 
        chose a different project topic.</li> 
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><em>Support.</em> I am very happy to talk with you about the available 
    project topics to help you decide which topic is best for you. I am also 
    happy to hep you work through an example to make sure you understand your 
    topic. We will be working on the projects for the last week of the term, 
    so you will have opportunities to discuss the topics with me and with your 
    classmates. As always, you are also welcome in Office Hours.
