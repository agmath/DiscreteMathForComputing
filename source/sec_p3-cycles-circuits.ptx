    <p><em>Eulerian Circuits and Hamiltonian Cycles.</em> In this project,
    students will explore Eulerian Circuits as well as Hamiltonian Cycles 
    in graphs. As part of your project, you should be sure to define both 
    Eulerian circuits and Hamiltonian cycles, construct examples of graphs 
    for which these structures exist and other examples of graphs for 
    which they do not exist. Your project should also discuss the 
    conditions under which these structures can be found in graphs. You 
    may even elect to discuss some interesting applications of these 
    structures or some existing unsolved problems involving them.
