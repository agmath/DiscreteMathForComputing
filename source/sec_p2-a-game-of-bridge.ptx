  <title>A Game of Bridge</title>

  <introduction>
    <p><em>Note.</em> This project can be completing with or without 
    coding. Part 3 of the project is difficult without coding.
    </p>

    <p>In this Squid Game-inspired project, you'll analyse a bridge-
    crossing game. Various scenarios will be considered. In each 
    scenario, the game is as follows. All players begin at one end 
    of the bridge, with the goal of getting all the way to the other 
    side. The bridge consists of glass panes, each of which will turn 
    red or green when stepped on. If a player stops on a pane and it 
    turns red, that player is out. All lit panes remain lit for the 
    entirety of the game (so later players have an advantage). Players 
    will cross the bridge one at a time, in a predetermined order. You 
    may also assume that the glass panes are large enough that players 
    may not jump over segments of the bridge. That is, in the picture 
    below, the players begin from the left side of the bridge and each 
    player must step on one of the two panes in each column in an attempt 
    to reach the right hand side of the bridge.

    <p> Analyse the game by finding the expected number of players 
    reaching the opposite end of the bridge safely (without stepping on 
    a red glass pane) in each of the following scenarios.
    <ol>
        <li> The bridge contains 2 glass panes in each segment and there 
        are 18 segments to cross the entire bridge. That is, the bridge 
        is like the one in the image above, but it contains 18 columns 
        rather than just four. Each segment contains one pane that will 
        light green and one pane that will light red.</li>
        <li> The bridge contains 3 glass panes in each segment and there 
        are 18 segments to cross the entire bridge. Each segment contains 
        two panes that will light green and one pane that will light red.</li>
        <li> The bridge contains 3 glass panes in each segment and there 
        are 18 segments to cross the entire bridge. Each segment contains 
        two panes that will light red and one that will light green.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Topic Expectations.</em> All code or mathematics for each 
    scenario should be included as an appendix to your paper. In addition 
    to your supporting work and your solutions to the expected number of 
    players, your paper should:
    <ul>
        <li> Describe what your code/mathematics does, and what changes 
        you needed to make for each scenario.</li>
        <li> Explain why your code/mathematics accurately simulates 
        or models the scenario.</li>
        <li> When finding the expected number of players, explain why it 
        makes sense for the expected numbers in some parts to be bigger 
        or smaller than other parts.</li>
        <li> Explain why the third part is more difficult to solve than 
        the first two parts.</li>
    </ul>
