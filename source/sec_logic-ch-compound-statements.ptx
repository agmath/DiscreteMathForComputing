  <title>Compound Statements, Truth Tables, and Logical Equivalence</title>

<introduction>

<p> In the previous section we were introduced to <em>statements</em> and our
four foundational logical operators -- the negation (<m>!p</m>), the conjunction 
(<m>p\land q</m>), the disjunction (<m>p \lor q</m>), and the implication 
(<m>p\to q</m>). We described <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> as <em>atomic</em> statements 
and these statements involving operators as <em>compound logical statements</em>. 
We also evaluated the conditions under which these compound logical statements 
are true by constructing tables called truth tables. A single table summarizing 
the results from that previous section appears below:

    <table>
    <tabular halign="center">
    <row header="yes" bottom="minor" >
      <cell><m>p</m></cell>
      <cell><m>q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>!p</m></cell>
      <cell><m>p\land q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>p\lor q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>p \to q</m></cell>
    </row>

    </row>
    </tabular>

<p>Given your previous experience with mathematics, it likely comes as no surprise 
to you that we can combine our statements and logical operators together to build 
more complex logical statements. These more complex statements will be the focus of 
this section of our text.

<subsection><title>Truth Tables</title>

<p>In both the previous section and also the introduction to this section, we've 
utilized truth tables to analyse the conditions under which our compound logical 
statements are <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. We've used this structures without 
much explanation though, so we'll take a moment to discuss them here.</p>

<p>In short, a truth table is a stucture which allows us to systematically analyze 
truth values for logical statements. The number of rows and columns in a truth table 
will depend on the complexity of the logical statement to be analysed. For a logical 
statement that includes <m>n</m> distinct atomic statements, a truth table with 
<m>2^n</m> rows is required to capture all of the combinations of truth and falsity 
for each of the atomic statements. The number of columns in the truth table will 
vary with the number of operators in the statement. You can (and should) use the 
strategy below when constructing a truth table to analyze a logical statement or 
argument.

  <ol>
    <li> Identify the number of atomic statements included in the compound logical 
    statement.</li> 
    <ul> 
      <li> As a reminder, each atomic statement will be represented by a 
      lowercase letter in the symbolic form of the logical statement.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Build a truth table with <m>2^n</m> rows (not including the header row), 
    where <m>n</m> is the number of atomic statements you identified in step 1.</li>
    <li> Build a column for each of the individual atomic statements.</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> Beginning with the right-most atomic statement in the table, alternate 
      T/F/T/F/T/F/T/F... all the way down the table.</li>
      <li> Move one column to the left and fill in the column for your next atomic 
      statement by doubling the number of T's and F's appearing together. That is, 
      fill in the column with T/T/F/F/T/T/F/F...</li>
      <li> Continue moving to the left one column at a time and filling in the 
      column by doubling the number of consecutive trues and falses appearing in 
      the column to the right until you have a column built for each atomic 
      statement. For this next column you'd have four trues followed by four falses 
      over and over again. Then eight trues with eight falses, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <li> Look for any negation operators attached to atomic statements and build a 
    column in the truth table for each negated atomic statement that appears.</li>
    <li> The order of operations for logic are: <em>parentheses</em>, 
    <em>negations</em>, <em>conjunctions</em>/<em>disjunctions</em> (left to right),
    and then <em>implications</em>. Slowly add columns to your truth table according 
    to this order of operations that will build up to the full compound logical 
    statement you are analyzing.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> PRO TIP: Add new columns so that can be populated with their T/F values 
      by looking only at one or two existing columns in your truth table. If you are 
      looking at more than two columns to decide whether to place a T or F in your 
      new column, you'll make mistakes.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</p>

<p> Consider the following truth table as an example for analyzing the truth values 
of <m>\left(p\lor !q\right)\implies !r</m>.

<table>
    <tabular halign="center">
    <row header="yes" bottom="minor" >
      <cell><m>p</m></cell>
      <cell><m>q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>r</m></cell>
      <cell><m>!q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>!r</m></cell>
      <cell><m>p\lor !q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>\left(p \lor !q\right)\to !r</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    </tabular>
    </table>

Consider the following questions before trying to fill in the truth table on 
your own.

<ol type="a">
  <li> Why are there 8 rows in this truth table? Is having 8 correct?</li>
  <li> Why isn't there a <m>!p</m> column if there are columns for  
  <m>!q</m> and <m>!r</m>?</li>
  <li> Are 7 columns appropriate here? Can we fill in each column by looking 
  at the truth values in at most two columns to the left of it?</li>
</ol>

Now fill in the remaining truth values before moving on.
