  <title>Compound Statements, Truth Tables, and Logical Equivalence</title>

<introduction>

<p> In the previous section we were introduced to <em>statements</em> and our
four foundational logical operators -- the negation (<m>!p</m>), the conjunction 
(<m>p\land q</m>), the disjunction (<m>p \lor q</m>), and the implication 
(<m>p\to q</m>). We described <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> as <em>atomic</em> statements 
and these statements involving operators as <em>compound logical statements</em>. 
We also evaluated the conditions under which these compound logical statements 
are true by constructing tables called truth tables. A single table summarizing 
the results from that previous section appears below:

    <table>
    <tabular halign="center">
    <row header="yes" bottom="minor" >
      <cell><m>p</m></cell>
      <cell><m>q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>!p</m></cell>
      <cell><m>p\land q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>p\lor q</m></cell>
      <cell><m>p \implies q</m></cell>
    </row>
