			<title>About This Text</title>
			
			<p>This interactive, IBL, text was designed for use in a first-year course in Discrete Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University. The course is designed for students taking a first semester of discrete mathematics in conjunction with an introductory programming course. Discrete mathematics content is introduced in time for it to be utilized in the corrsponding programming class.</p>
			
			<p>At Southern New Hampshire University, first-semester Computer Science tudents take CS113 (an introductory course in C++) and also traditionally took a course in Discrete Mathematics designed for general education purposes. In 2020, this Discrete Mathematics course was phased out and was replaced by a Discrete Mathematics for Computing course. Topics from the original Discrete Mathematics course were rearranged such that they are covered in time to be used in the CS113 class. Because the course is advertised as a mathematics <i>for computing</i> course, connections are explicitly made between the mathematics and programming concepts.</p>
			
			<p>Since the course has been developed, students majoring in Information Technology and students majoring in Game Programming have been encouraged by their major faculty to enroll as well. Those programs utilize Python and C#, respectively, in their first-semester coursework. For these reasons, we've attempted to build the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course (and this accompanying text) as "language agnostic" experiences. A table of aligned coverage for the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course and the corresponding first-semester programming coursework in the partner programs appears below.</p>
