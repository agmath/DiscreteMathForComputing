<p>At Southern New Hampshire University, first-semester Computer Science tudents take CS113 (an introductory course in C++) and also traditionally took a course in Discrete Mathematics designed for general education purposes. In 2020, this Discrete Mathematics course was phased out and was replaced by a Discrete Mathematics for Computing course. Topics from the original Discrete Mathematics course were rearranged such that they are covered in time to be used in the CS113 class. Because the course is advertised as a mathematics for computing course, connections are explicitly made between the mathematics and programming concepts. Since the course has been developed, students majoring in Information Technology and students majoring in Game Programming have been encouraged to enroll as well. Those programs utilize Python and C# in their first-semester coursework, respectively. For these reasons, we've attempted to build the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course (and this accompanying text) as "language agnostic" experiences. A table of aligned coverage for the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course and the corresponding first-semester programming coursework in the partner programs appears below.</p>
