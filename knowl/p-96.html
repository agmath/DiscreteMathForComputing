<p>Written and spoken language can have ambiguous meaning. For example, if we say "I will be at the gym or I will be studying at the library", what we really mean is that I will be doing one or the other -- but not both. In mathematics we do not work with ambiguity, indeed compound statements -- individual (atomic) statements joined by logical operators (like <em class="emphasis">or</em>) -- must be statements in their own right. That is, these compound logical statements must be true or false, but not both. For this reason, we'll develop <em class="emphasis">symbolic logic</em>, including a set of boolean (true/false) algebraic operators in our further exploration of logic.</p>
