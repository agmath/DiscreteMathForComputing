<p>Now that we know how to evaluate logical expressions, the next natural question to ask is "when are two logical expressions equivalent to one another?". Simply put, two expressions are logically equivalent if they have exactly the same truth values under the same conditions. In terms of their truth tables, they have exactly the same combination of <em class="emphasis">trues</em> and <em class="emphasis">falses</em> in exactly the same order (as long as the atomic statements are arranged identically). This means that, if we build a truth table for each of the statements in queston, ensuring that the tables include the same atomic statements and that the truth values for those atomic statements appear in the same order, then two statements are logically equivalent if the final columns in their truth tables are identical.</p>
