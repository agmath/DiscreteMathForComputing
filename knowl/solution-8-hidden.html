<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">Note that the routine uses three operations in order to transform the input <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">array</code> into the value which is returned. First, the item in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">array[0]</code> is stored in the variable <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Next, the intem in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">array[1]</code> is stored in the variable <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Finally, the sum, <span class="process-math">\(a + b\)</span> is stored in the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">total</code> variable, which is the value to be returned. Three operations are being completed here, so we might say that this routine has run-time complexity <span class="process-math">\(O\left(3\right)\text{.}\)</span> The attentive reader may ask why this routine is not <span class="process-math">\(O\left(4\right)\)</span> because of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">return</code> statement. In short, we shouldn't waste time making a distinction because, regardless of whether we consider <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">return</code>ing a value to be an operation or not, this routine has <em class="emphasis">constant</em> run-time. That is, this routine is also <span class="process-math">\(O\left(1\right)\text{.}\)</span>
