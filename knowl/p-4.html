<p>Since the course has been developed, students majoring in Information Technology and students majoring in Game Programming have been encouraged by their major faculty to enroll as well. Those programs utilize Python and C#, respectively, in their first-semester coursework. For these reasons, we've attempted to build the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course (and this accompanying text) as "language agnostic" experiences. A table of aligned coverage for the Discrete Mathematics for Computing course and the corresponding first-semester programming coursework in the partner programs appears below.</p>
